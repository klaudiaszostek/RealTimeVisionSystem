# Multi-Module Vision System for Real-Time Person Identification and Threat Detection
The aim is to develop a working prototype of an intelligent security system based on real-time image analysis. The system will enable face recognition from camera footage and detect potential threats such as the presence of dangerous objects (e.g., weapons). 
The expected outcome is a functional application integrating face recognition and object detection modules, with a user interface tailored for security personnel.
The project will be developed using technologies such as Python, OpenCV, and pre-trained AI models. Real-time video processing will be implemented, and selected events will be saved and labeled in the system.
